            From an ambitious pet feeder to a robust autonomous retrieval
            system. This project was a lesson in hardware reality, requiring us
            to pivot, adapt, and engineer creative solutions to bridge the gap
            between theory and the physical world.

          <h2>Project Assessment</h2>
          <p>
            While we ultimately pivoted away from the granular "Pet Feeder"
            application due to gripper limitations, our final "Fetch"
            implementation successfully met all the core technical design
            criteria. The robot demonstrated
            <strong>autonomous perception</strong> of a target,
            <strong>smooth trajectory planning</strong> using Bézier curves, and
            <strong>multi-stage manipulation</strong> to interact with the
            environment.
          </p>
          <p>
            The system proved that the Innate Mars platform, despite its
            documentation gaps and hardware quirks, is capable of complex tasks
            when governed by a robust software architecture.

          <h2>Limitations & Future Improvements</h2>
          <p>
            Given the timeline constraints, several "hacks" were implemented to
            ensure stability. With additional time, we would address these
            technical debt items to create a truly production-ready system.

              <h3>Robust Perception</h3>
              <p>
                <strong>Current Flaw:</strong> Our vision system relies on
                simple color thresholding and plane filtering. This makes it
                sensitive to lighting changes.<br />
                <strong>Improvement:</strong> Implement machine learning-based
                object detection (YOLO) and integrate the LiDAR sensor to fuse
                depth data, allowing detection of non-white objects in complex
                backgrounds.

              <h3>True Localization</h3>
              <p>
                <strong>Current Flaw:</strong> The "Return to Base" feature
                currently relies on simple odometry tracking (reversing distance
                d), which accumulates drift over time.<br />
                <strong>Improvement:</strong> Implement SLAM (Simultaneous
                Localization and Mapping) to allow the robot to navigate back to
                a specific (x,y) coordinate map, regardless of the path taken.

              <h3>Visual Servoing</h3>
              <p>
                <strong>Current Flaw:</strong> The arm moves to a pre-calculated
                coordinate and grabs blindly. If the robot slips during the
                approach, the grasp fails.<br />
                <strong>Improvement:</strong> Implement "Visual Servoing"
                (closed-loop control), where the arm camera continuously
                corrects the hand position <em>during</em> the descent phase.
